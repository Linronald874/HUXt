HUXt todo:

- Modify load/save to save disc space: Ignore tracer field if no Br was specified. Ignore CME tracer and CME fields if there's no CME
- Remove stored MAS outputs, as that's obsolete now that the web-scaper function exists. (Maybe save one CR of the new format inputs as a demo?)
- Modify examples notebook to account for new functionality
